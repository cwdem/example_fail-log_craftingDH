# Week 1 fail log
First fail - I have no idea what my username and password should be for the VPN.

## Comments/Concerns

Overall, this week went well. It seemed daunting at first, but I soon realized that everyone makes mistakes, especially when they are learning new skills, using new software, etc. **Making mistakes is part of the process and necessary to learn.**

I am a bit concerned about diving into GitHub next week, but I see there are instruction videos which I imagine will help a lot!
